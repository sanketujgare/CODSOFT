This repository contains all the tasks given in the Java development internship.

## In this internship the 5 task was assigned.

1. Number Game :dizzy::
   
   Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
   Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number. 
   Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guesses are correct, too high, or too low.
   Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
   You can incorporate additional details as follows. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again. 
   Display the user's score, which can be based on 
   The number of attempts taken or rounds won

2. Student Grade Calculator :dizzy: :
   
   Input: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
   Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
   Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the
   average percentage.
   Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
   Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the use

3. ATM Interface :dizzy::
   
   Create a class to represent the ATM machine. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
   checking the balance.
   Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance(), Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
   Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
   Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
   of their transactions.

4. Currency converter :dizzy::
   
   Currency Selection: Allow the user to choose the base currency and the target currency.
   Currency Rates: Fetch real-time exchange rates from a reliable API.
   Amount Input: Take input from the user for the amount they want to convert.
   Currency Conversion: Convert the input amount from the base currency to the
   target currency using the fetched exchange rate.
   Display Result: Show the converted amount and the target currency symbol to the user.

5. Student Management System :dizzy:
   Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll
   number, grade, and any other relevant details.
   Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include
   methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.
   Design the user interface for the Student Management System. This can be a console-based
   interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
   Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a
   database.
   Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
   adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all
   students, and exiting the application.
   Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student
   data is in the correct format
